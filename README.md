# Analyzing Gambling Behavior on Bustabit 🎲

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of online gambling behavior collected from the Bustabit platform. The dataset contains detailed information about player actions, including their bets, winnings, and timing of cash-outs, which allows us to study decision-making under uncertainty.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset, titled ["Gambling Behavior on Bustabit"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/gambling-behavior-bustabit), is hosted on Kaggle and includes:
- Player bets in "Bits" (1/1,000,000th of a Bitcoin).
- Multiplier values at cash-out.
- Profit calculations based on player actions and bonuses.
- Detailed logs of game outcomes, including "busts."

Bustabit is a high-risk, high-reward online gambling game where players must decide when to cash out before the game "busts" to maximize their profit. This dataset is ideal for studying risk tolerance, strategy optimization, and decision-making processes.

## 🔍 Project Goals
1. **Analyze player behavior**:
   - When do players cash out, and how does this affect their profit?
   - Are there observable patterns or strategies among players?

2. **Explore risk and reward dynamics**:
   - How do players balance the risk of losing with the potential for larger rewards?

3. **Understand house advantages**:
   - Investigate how the built-in game mechanics (e.g., 1/100 games busting for all players) impact player outcomes.
